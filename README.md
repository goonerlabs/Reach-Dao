# Reach-Dao

The DApp allows any user to create a proposal for other users to contribute to and vote on. If the proposal passes, it becomes a bounty funded by the contributions as well as funds raised from sponsors. If the proposal does not pass, all users who contributed can claim a refund on the amounts that each of them contributed.  


A proposal could be a fullscale DApp, A part of a DApp, A tutorial, or frameworks or tools that make building DApps easier and faster for developers. However, proposals are not limited to this and look forward to creative ways users use the DApp.

The central idea behind the Reach DAO is to allow projects to be executed or actualized faster by incentivising them via bounties while also providing an avenue for Developers to gain much needed experience and expertise and earn money while doing this. 

The end game is for the Reach DAO to be a hub for developers with the benefit, and hope that users create proposals with this in mind.
Those who are not developers but have projects that they may want to execute are also invited to create proposals.

In a nutshell, the primary function of the DApp is to connect software developers with work.
The primary features include:
Creating proposals
Voting on these proposals
Contributing to proposals

As a self-taught developer, I know how difficult it is to transition from taking courses, learning, and tutorials to getting actual paid employment. Recruiters tend to require a Computer Science Degree with years of experience even for internships or may have a preference for hiring from their network of alumni and may offer different remuneration to people in different jurisdictions for the same work. 

I came up with the idea to build something that could help developers gain experience and improve their skills while earning some money to boost their confidence and take care of some bills. I also wanted to link talent with ideas whereby anyone with an idea for a project could create a proposal and fund a bounty which a developer could complete the bounty and claim the rewards.


So anyone that has a job (like a full-scale DApp, assistance with parts of their DApp development, or a benevolent fellow that wants a tutorial created for the community) could create a proposal.


The voting element is there to prevent distasteful projects from being promoted and help the proposer gauge the level of interest in their idea. And people can even contribute to funding the proposal as well if they do like the idea. If the proposal passes the vote, it becomes a bounty, so any developer can then go ahead and do the work and claim the bounty and if it doesn't pass, then those who contributed can reclaim their contributions.


A DAO, Decentralised Autonomous Organization, is a permission-less sort of organization so you don't need to submit a CV or resume or have years of experience or anything like that, all you have to do is complete the job and you automatically get paid upon submission of your proof of completion. Humans can be easily corrupted or start engaging in nepotism e.t.c. but computers can't and would always apply the same rules to everyone irrespective of who they are.

### USAGE

**Please be aware that you would have to sign multiple transactions on your metamask while going through most of the steps below.**

**Please Note that the DApp only works on polygon testnet so you should change your metamask to polygon testnet**

1. Open a few tabs in your favourite browser (at least 3 tabs).

2. Navigate to the app at the URL **https://reach-dao-five.vercel.app/``.**  

3. Click on the Connect wallet button to connect your wallet.  

4. Click on the Deploy button to deploy the contract as an Admin/ Deployer in the first tab.

5. Copy the contract information to the clipboard by clicking on the Copy to Clipboard button and then head on over to the next tab and follow steps 1 - 3 after which you can attach to the contract as a new user by clicking on Attach and pasting the contract information and clicking on the the button to attach.

6. You would be greeted by the Welcome page.

7. Please navigate to the Proposals page by clicking on the Proposals button on the top right-hand side of your screen. You can then go ahead to create a proposal by clicking on the Make a Proposal button and  filling out all the fields of the form after which the proposal would be added to the list of active proposals.

8. After creating a proposal, you can go to the next tab and attach as a seperate user following the processes described in steps above and navigate to the proposals page. You would see a list of active proposals and can go ahead to upvote, downvote or contribute to any proposal that you choose to.  

A user may upvote, downvote or contribute to a proposal before the proposal deadline which starts counting as soon as the proposal is created, This is currently set to 5 blocks.  

If a proposal passes i.e it has more upvotes than downvotes after the deadline elapses, the proposal is moved to the list of active bounties which can be found on the bounties page. If the proposal fails then any user who contributed can claim a refund by clicking on the claim refund button which becomes visible when a proposal fails.  

I encourage you to play around with the DApp and create as many proposals as you want to and upvote, downvote and contribute to them.
